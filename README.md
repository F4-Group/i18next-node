# PREVIEW TO v2.0.0 beta

Currently we work hard on getting out [v2.0.0 of i18next](https://github.com/i18next/i18next/tree/2.0.0). It's a complete rewrite of the current code base from 2011 and will assert i18next is ready for the next big things that will come.

Current state is **beta**.

- [Getting started](http://i18next.github.io/i18next.com/docs/)
- [API](http://i18next.github.io/i18next.com/docs/api/)
- [Translate](http://i18next.github.io/i18next.com/translate/)
- [Migration Guide](http://i18next.github.io/i18next.com/docs/migration/)

Source can be loaded via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18next), bower or [downloaded](https://github.com/i18next/i18next/blob/2.0.0/i18next.min.js) from this repo.


```bash
# npm
$ npm install i18next@beta

# bower
$ bower install i18next/i18next#2.0.0
```

---------

We highly encourage maintainers of modules using i18next to migrate to v2.


In our company we already use v2.0.0 in production, so for people starting a new project we recommend directly using v2.

For people already using i18next in production we recommend to wait for first release - but still feel free to play with it and giving early feedback before the release gets finalized.

# Introduction

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/i18next/i18next-node.png)](http://travis-ci.org/i18next/i18next-node)

Project goal is to provide the same easy way to translate a website on serverside like in
[i18next](https://github.com/i18next/i18next) on the clientside:

- Translation inside your server code or template
- loading resourcefiles
- update resourcefiles with missing strings
- interpolation, plurals, nesting or resources
- serve the same resources to the clientside

# installation

	npm install i18next

# usage

First require the module and init i18next:

```js
var i18next = require('i18next');
i18next.init(); // for options see i18next-node gh-page
```

Register the express middleware, so we can check current language settings:

```js
// Configuration
app.configure(function() {
    app.use(express.bodyParser());
    app.use(i18next.handle);
    app.use(app.router);

    [...]
});
```

Register AppHelper so you can use the translate function in your template:

```js
i18next.registerAppHelper(app)
```

Now you can (depending on your template language) do something like this in your template(jade example):

```jade
body
span= t('app.name')
```

To serve the clientside script and needed routes for resources and missing keys:

```js
i18next.serveClientScript(app)
    .serveDynamicResources(app)
    .serveMissingKeyRoute(app);
```

now you can add the script to you page and use i18next on the client like on the server:

```jade
script(src='i18next/i18next.js', type='text/javascript')
```

```js
$.i18n.init([options], function() {
    $('#appname').text($.t('app.name'));
});
```
